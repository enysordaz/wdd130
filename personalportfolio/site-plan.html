      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        We are Enys, Angela and Alma, three teenage sisters, seeking to promote learning in the technological field and spread its importance to young people and children.
      </p>
      <h4>Our vision</h4>
      <p>
        It is that more young people are interested and know about jobs, opportunities that help achieve a brighter future, working on environmental solutions, technology, creation, programming and more.
      </p>
      <h4>Our mission</h4>
      <p>
        It is to inspire young people between the ages of 12 and 18 to decide what they want to spend their time doing in the technological field, that both women and men can choose, and that they can achieve it by passing any test.

      <h3>Women in STEM</h3>
      <p>
        STEM careers have no gender. They have great potential, demand and future.
        If women feel identified with certain areas of study, more inclusive societies can be built where young women are encouraged to follow their vocation, develop new skills and contribute their talent.

      <h3>Clean Energies</h3>
      <p>
        After conducting my scientific research I discovered shocking data, immense climate change, a large percentage of animals in danger of extinction that is increasing and the excessive consumption of fossil fuels.
        Of the renewable energy currently in use globally is only: 10.8%
        - Eolic energy: information
        - Solar energy: information
